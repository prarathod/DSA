1 ) Sum triangle from array
Difficulty Level : Easy
Last Updated : 10 Jun, 2021
Given an array of integers, print a sum triangle from it such that the first level has all array elements. From then, at each level number of elements is one less than the previous level and elements at the level is be the Sum of consecutive two elements in the previous level. 
Example :
 

Input : A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output : [48]
         [20, 28] 
         [8, 12, 16] 
         [3, 5, 7, 9] 
         [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 

Explanation :
Here,   [48]
        [20, 28] -->(20 + 28 = 48)
        [8, 12, 16] -->(8 + 12 = 20, 12 + 16 = 28)
        [3, 5, 7, 9] -->(3 + 5 = 8, 5 + 7 = 12, 7 + 9 = 16)
        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -->(1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 4 = 7, 4 + 5 = 9)

Difficulty Level : Easy
Last Updated : 23 Apr, 2021
Given an array of integers arr, the task is to find the minimum and maximum element of that array using recursion.
Input: arr = {1, 4, 3, -5, -4, 8, 6};
Output: min = -5, max = 8

Input: arr = {1, 4, 45, 6, 10, -8};
Output: min = -8, max = 45


3rd:- First uppercase letter in a string (Iterative and Recursive)
Difficulty Level : Basic
Last Updated : 26 Apr, 2021
Given a string find its first uppercase letter
Examples : 

Input : geeksforgeeKs
Output : K

Input  : geekS
Output : S



3rd:-Reverse String
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

Example 1:

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]


4th:-Program for length of a string using recursion
Given a string calculate length of the string using recursion. 
Examples: 
 
Input : str = "abcd"
Output :4


4th:- Geek-onacci Number,
eek created a random series and given a name geek-onacci series. Given four integers A, B, C, N. A, B, C represents the first three numbers of geek-onacci series. Find the Nth number of the series. The nth number of geek-onacci series is a sum of the last three numbers (summation of N-1th, N-2th, and N-3th geek-onacci numbers)

Input:
1. The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
2. The first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers A, B, C, and N.

Output: For each test case, print Nth geek-onacci number

Constraints:
1. 1 <= T <= 3
2. 1 <= A, B, C <= 100
3. 4 <= N <= 10

Example:
Input:
3
1 3 2 4
1 3 2 5
1 3 2 6

Output:
6
11
19
